We plan to implement a direct interface to Peter Corke's robotics toolbox in OpenOCL soon, let me know if you would like to get involved!
https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/issues/102

Collection of (very experimental) models for optimal control with OpenOCL.

Code generation of RTB model with symbolic toolbox and casadi: rtb_p560_symbolic_sim

rtb: models used with Peter Corke's robotics toolbox

For optimal control example see/run rtb_p560_symbolic_sim/p560_ocl_explicit_optimize.m

This repository is very experimental!
