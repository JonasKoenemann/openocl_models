Collection of models for optimal control with OpenOCL

rtb: models used with Peter Corke's robotics toolbox

For optimal control example see rtb_puma560

## requirements (from https://github.com/jkoendev/): 

* https://github.com/openocl/toolbox-common-matlab
* https://github.com/openocl/robotics-toolbox-matlab
* https://openocl.org/

Add to path and run setup rtb

```
addpath toolbox-common-matlab
cd robotics-toolbox-matlab
startup_rtb
```

Setup OpenOCL

```
ocl
```

this repository is very experimental!
